# Pipeline

A PSR-7 middleware dispatcher.

## Installation, Autoloading, and Tests

This package is installable and PSR-4 autoloadable via Composer as `pipeline/pipeline`.

Alternatively, download a release or clone this repository, then map the `Pipeline\Pipeline\` namespace to the package `src/` directory.

This package requires PHP 5.5 or later; it has been tested on PHP 5.6, PHP 7, and HHVM. We recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle.

To run the tests, issue `composer install` to install the test dependencies, then issue `phpunit`.

## Middleware Signature

A _Pipeline_ middleware callable must have the following signature:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;

function (
    Request $request,   // the incoming request
    Response $response, // the outgoing response
    callable $next      // the next middleware
) {
    // ...
}
```

## Middleware Dispatching

Create a `$queue` array of middleware callables:

```php
$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {
    // 1st middleware
};

$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {
    // 2nd middleware
};

// ...

$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {
    // Nth middleware
};
```

Create a _Pipeline_ with the `$queue`, and invoke it with a request and response.

```php
/**
 * @var \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request
 * @var \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response
 */

use Pipeline\Pipeline\Pipeline;

$dispatcher = new Pipeline($queue);
$dispatcher($request, $response);
```

That will execute each of the middlewares in first-in-first-out order.

## Middleware Logic

Your middleware logic should follow this pattern:

- Receive the incoming request and response objects from the previous middleware as parameters, along with the next middleware as a callable.

- Optionally modify the received request and response as desired.

- Optionally invoke the next middleware with the request and response, receiving a new response in return.

- Optionally modify the returned response as desired.

- Return the response to the previous middleware.

Here is a skeleton example; your own middleware may or may not perform the various optional processes:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;

$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {

    // optionally modify the incoming request
    $request = $request->...;

    // optionally skip the $next middleware and return early
    if (...) {
        return $response;
    }

    // optionally invoke the $next middleware and get back a new response
    $response = $next($request, $response);

    // optionally modify the Response if desired
    $response = $response->...;

    // NOT OPTIONAL: return the Response to the previous middleware
    return $response;
};
```

> N.b.: You should **always** return the response from your middleware logic.

Remember that the request and response are **immutable**. Implicit in that is the fact that changes to the request are always transmitted to the `$next` middleware but never to the previous one.

Note also that this logic chain means the request and response are subjected to two passes through each middleware:

- first on the way "in" through each middleware via the `$next` middleware invocation,

- then on the way "out" from each middleware via the `return` to the previous middleware.

For example, if the middleware queue looks like this:

```php
$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {
    // "Foo"
};

$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {
    // "Bar"
};

$queue[] = function (Request $request, Response $response, callable $next) {
    // "Baz"
};
```

... the request and response path through the middlewares will look like this:

```
Foo is 1st on the way in
    Bar is 2nd on the way in
        Baz is 3rd on the way in, and 1st on the way out
    Bar is 2nd on the way out
Foo is 3rd on the way out
```

You can use this dual-pass logic in clever and perhaps unintuitive ways. For example, middleware placed at the very start may do nothing with the request and call `$next` right away, but it is the middleware with the "real" last opportunity to modify the response.

## Resolvers

You may wish to use `$queue` entries other than anonymous functions. If so, you can pass a `$resolver` callable to the _Pipeline_ that will convert the `$queue` entry to a callable. Thus, using a `$resolver` allows you to pass in your own factory mechanism for `$queue` entries.

For example, this `$resolver` will naively convert `$queue` string entries to new class instances:

```php
$resolver = function ($class) {
    return new $class();
};
```

You can then add `$queue` entries as class names, and the _Pipeline_ will use the
`$resolver` to create the objects in turn.

```php
use Pipeline\Pipeline\Pipeline;

$queue[] = 'FooMiddleware';
$queue[] = 'BarMiddleware';
$queue[] = 'BazMiddleware';

$dispatcher = new Pipeline($queue, $resolver);
```

As long as the classes listed in the `$queue` implement `__invoke(Request $request, Response $response, callable $next)`, then the _Pipeline_ will work correctly.
